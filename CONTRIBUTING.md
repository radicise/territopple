# Contributing
Hi there, and welcome to the Territopple repository!  
We love outside contributions and are excited that you're considering helping us out.  
However, there are a few [rules](#rules) and [guidelines](#guidelines) to contributing, be sure to look over these *before* you start.

## The Codebase
It is highly reccommended (though not required) that you familiarize yourself with the codebase, particularly the parts that you want to contribute to.  

## Issues
Anyone is free to create an issue, including you. Issues are the first step to contributing, as they let us know what people want to see, and let us keep track of who is working on what.  
When you see an issue you want to tackle, or if you've just made an issue for something you want to do, let us know in the comments.  
Tell us that you want to work on it, and we'll assign you to the issue.  
Additionally, feel free to ask any questions you might have about the issue, this codebase can be confusing at times, especially with identifying what is relevant.

## Submitting A Pull Request
1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Make your changes
4. Organize the changes into one or more logical, descriptive commits
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Rules
These rules are non-negotiable, failure to follow them will result in your pull request being denied 100% of the time, so read them thoroughly.  

### 1) Absolutely NO 'Vibe Coding'
We get that LLMs are popular these days. However, our experience with them is that they do not produce any quality code when faced with this codebase due to it being entirely handwritten and not using trivial programming patterns.  
AI models do not work in our codebase, and we expect you to respect our time by not submitting code that you did not produce.  

While AI generated code is banned, you are free to submit AI assisted code. Meaning code that is primarily written by you.  
If we believe that your code is AI generated, we will begin asking you questions about it (such as why certain design choices were made), if you are unable to answer these questions, your submission will be denied.

### 2) Do not submit changes to unimportant files
If there is not a specific issue requesting changes to a file that is used solely for the purposes of debugging or utility, do not make changes to it. This rule exists to reduce the workload on us when reviewing submissions.  
Examples of these files would be the "t2b" utility, or any of the dozens of files that are no longer in use.

### 3) Do not submit changes in bad faith
Obvious examples would be malware or introducing vulnerabilities.  
However, this also includes wasting our time, if you receive a request for changes and respond with changes that neither address all of the issues in the request, nor provide adequate reasons why the issues have not been addressed, it will be denied.

## Guidelines
While these are not mandatory, adhering to these will significantly boost the chances that we accept your submission.

* Be polite
* Match the style of your code to that of the codebase, look at similar code to determine the appropriate style
* Keep the submission as focused as possible. Ideally, you will have one feature per submission.
* Make sure you address all parts of the issue, or explain why you have not addressed certain parts.
* If you receive a request for changes, this means we are very likely to accept the submission once those changes are made. Please be sure to address them and ask clarifying questions if needed.
