Territopple is a game based on the game Culture by Secret Lab Pty. Ltd.. It is a
multiplayer strategy game.
The gameplay is simple. At least two players play, the game's state being
defined by that of a rectangular board and whose turn it is. Each tile on the
board has a value and and is either owned by a single player or is not owned by
any player The board starts off with each tile having a value of 1 and not being
owned by any player. The players take turns in a cyclic fashion in which the
player whose turn it is selects a tile that is not owned by another player. The
selected tile has its value increased by 1, and its owner set to the player whose
turn it is. If the tile's value exceeds the amount of neighbors that the tile
has, its value decreases by that amount of neighbors and each of the neighbors
has its own value incremented by 1, its owner set to the player whose turn it is,
and, if its own value exceeds the amount of neighbors it has, this process of
spreading happens with the tile being considered. If at any step of this
calculation the player whose turn it is occupies owns all tiles, they win. If and
when a player loses all valid moves, their turn is skipped for the remainder of
the game. The players take turns until one of them wins.
