Territopple is a multiplayer strategy game based on the game Culture by Secret Lab Pty. Ltd..

The game is played on a rectangular board. Each tile on the board has a number of pieces on it, and is either owned or unowned.
The game starts with one piece on each tile. Players take turns placing pieces onto the board, either on spaces they own or spaces that are unowned.
If a tile has more pieces on it than it has neighbors, it topples, resetting to one piece and adding a piece to each neighbor.
This can in turn cause those tiles to topple as well. If a tile topples onto a tile owned by someone else, that tile is captured.
If a player has no valid moves, they lose. The game ends when one person owns all the tiles on the board.
