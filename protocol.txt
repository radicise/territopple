Game listing protocol:
- Client sends a POST request to http://host:8302/serverlist
- Server sends a single string response of the form of repeated "[room identifier string]_[width]_[height]_[0 for waiting on players, 1 for in progress]_[total amount of players and spectators in room]_[amount of players in the room still in the game]_[amount of players that the server requires / required to start the game];"

Game running protocol:
Ping:
clients can ping each other, they can choose to ping a specific player, the generic 'active' player, or all players
pings can come in multiple types, these are currently: default, flash
default can be resolved to any valid type either by the server or the client
clients may substitute ping types in the case that the requested type is disabled or unavailable
the active player is always the player who's turn is currently ongoing

- client sends "ping[{target}][,{type}]" when type is omitted, it is 'default', when target is omitted, it is 'active'
- server sends "ping{origin},{type}" to the target, or sends a distrMess in the case of target 'all'
