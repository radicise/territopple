this document describes the format of the ".topl" territopple replay file

version 0:
BYTE - version
BYTE[8] - name of game (stored as indicies into the codeChars array)
...BYTE[2|4] - actions

actions take the following form
BYTE[2] - 0xf0,PLAYERNUMBER - player disconnect, eliminated from game, etc
BYTE[4] - duo 16bit int, move coordinates, row then column

version 1:
BYTE - version
BYTE[8] - name of game (ASCII plain text)
BYTE - flags <a-f> where a is MSB
- a (TIMESTAMP) - includes timestamps // timestamps can get big, best to give option of disabling them
- b+c (SIZE) - combine as a 2bit selector, 00 (tiny) is 36x36 max, 01 (medium) is 256x256 max, 10 (large) is 4096x4096 max, 11 (huge) is 2^16x2^16 max // allows further space savings
BYTE[8] - game start timestamp (ms since Jan 1, 1970 UTC) // this is nice and only adds constant cost
BYTE[2] - width
BYTE[2] - height
BYTE - player count
-- garbage data between the timestamp and start of game is to be ignored, and does not make a topl invalid --
BYTE[2] - 0xf0,0x0f - start of game data
...EVENT
BYTE[4] - 0xff,0xf0,0x0f,0xff - end of replay // allows multiple replays to be put into one file

EVENT:
BYTE (TYPE) - type of event
IF (TIMESTAMP) set:
BYTE[2] - delta since previous timestamp (EXCEPTING if this is a TIMESTAMP event)
SWITCH (TYPE):
0 -> PLAYER ELIM: - player eliminated from turn order, reason not important
    BYTE - player number
1 -> PLAYER MOVE: - player moved
    SWITCH (SIZE):
        00 ->:
            BYTE[2] - R(5),C(5) the 6 bits on MSB side are reserved
        01 ->:
            BYTE[2] - R(8),C(8)
        10 ->:
            BYTE[3] - R(12),C(12)
        11 ->:
            BYTE[4] - R(16),C(16)
2 -> TIMESTAMP: - update the timestamp because nothing happened for over 18 hours
    BYTE[3] - delta time
