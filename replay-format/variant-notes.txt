this file documents the variants of replay files used for special purposes.

NOTE: ALL replay files use the file specified in './replay-fmt.txt', these variants make use of EXTMETA and EXTEVS to include additional information

.topl (dot topple):
    standard variant, this file is a replay of a game that has been completed (either by win or all players quitting)
    
    .topl files (and all derived variants) may OPTIONALLY contain the following EXTMETA table entries:
        'pn__' (see "./restrictkeys/pn__.txt") - player information
        'rlz_' (see "./restrictkeys/rlz_.txt") - rules information
        'col_' (see "./replay-mt-keys.txt") - team color information

.stpl (dot stopple):
    'suspended' topple, this file is the result of exporting an in-progress game to a file for the purpose of resuming it later
    
    .stpl files MUST contain the following EXTMETA table entries:
        'stpl' - format currently reserved, so meaningless data, but acts as a marker (the generator in this reposity initializes it to an array of length 1 containing 0x01 as the only element)
        'pn__' (see "./restrictkeys/pn__.txt") - player information, used to reconstruct which physical player is each particular player in the game
        'rlz_' (see "./restrictkeys/rlz_.txt") - rules information, used to reconstruct rules and the current state that players have within those rules (eg. time remain on turn timers)

.ctpl (see topple):
    'challenge' topple, this file represents a specific challenging scenario
    challenge topples are free from normal constraints on rendering (and thus dimensionality), as there
    is no option for a user to change any dimensions.
    this also allows challenge topples to use custom graphics without restriction.
    
    .ctpl files do not currently have a defined format, the extension is reserved for this purpose

.ttpl (tee topple):
    'template' topple, this file represents a template for a scenario
    template topples have some restrictions, namely in regards to rendering, as they must be able to
    render valid boards with arbitrary dimensions.
    some use of custom graphics is allowable.

    .ttpl files do not currently have a defined format, the extension is reserved for this purpose
