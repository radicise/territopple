                Welcome to Territopple!
            </h3>
            This short guide will teach you everything you need to know to start playing the eponymous territory toppling game. If you ever need a quick refresher on something, don't forget to check out the <a href="#reference">Reference</a>!
            <h3>
                Basic Layout:
            </h3>
            Territopple is played on a grid of tiles. Each tile will have one or more pieces on it, either belonging to a team or unclaimed.
            <h3>
                Turns:
            </h3>
            Players take turns in order. On their turn, each player must place a piece onto either a neutral space, or a space owned by their team.<br>
            If a player has no valid moves, they lose. Play continues until one team owns all the tiles.
            <h3>
                Toppling:
            </h3>
            If the number of pieces on a tile exceeds the number of neighbors that tile has, the tile will topple. Toppling resets a tile to having one piece, and adds a piece to each of its neighbors. This can cause chain reactions.<br>
            Any tile that is toppled onto will become owned by the team that just played their move.<br>
            Toppling is the only way to claim tiles that are already owned by other teams.<br>

            <h3>Doubling Up</h3>
            By creating a setup where there is a tile one piece away from being volatile, and multiple adjacent volatile pieces in the same volatile chain, a one-way path for toppling is made.<br>
            This allows you to safely set up topples onto your opponents without them being able to retaliate as easily.
