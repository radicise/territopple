                Welcome to Territopple!
            </h3>
            This short guide will teach you everything you need to know to start playing the eponymous territory toppling game. If you ever need a quick refresher on something, don't forget to check out the <a href="#reference">Reference</a>!
            <h3>
                Basic Layout:
            </h3>
            Territopple is played on a grid of tiles. Each tile will have one or more pieces on it, either belonging to a team or unclaimed.
            <h3>
                Turns:
            </h3>
            Players take turns in order. On their turn, each player must place a piece onto either a neutral space, or a space owned by their team.<br>
            If a player has no valid moves, they lose. Play continues until one team owns all the tiles.
            <h3>
                Toppling:
            </h3>
            If the number of pieces on a tile exceeds the number of neighbors that tile has, the tile will topple. Toppling resets a tile to having one piece, and adds a piece to each of its neighbors. This can cause chain reactions.<br>
            Any tile that is toppled onto will become owned by the team that just played their move.<br>
            Toppling is the only way to claim tiles that are already owned by other teams.<br>

            <h3>Elimination (Default)</h3>
            This is the default scoring option, and assigns players scores based on when they were eliminated. The last player standing wins.
            <h3>Tiles</h3>
            This mode calculates score as the sum of the number of tiles owned by the player after each move.
            <h3>Pieces</h3>
            This mode calculates score as the sum of the number of pieces owned by the player after each move.

            <h2 id="reference-topology">Topology</h2>
            <h3>2D Grid Topology (TGrid2D)</h3>
            This is the standard board topology, and is recommended for play.
            <h3>2D Single-Edge Wrap Topology (THWrap2D, TVWrap2D)</h3>
            These topologies have no corners, but do have edges.<br>
            Tiles on the left and right, top and bottom are adjacent for THWrap2D and TVWrap2D, respectively.
            <h3>2D Edge Wrap Topology (TBWrap2D)</h3>
            This topology has no corners and no edges.<br>
            Tiles on the left are adjacent with those on the right, and tiles on the top are adjacent with those on the bottom.
            <h2 id="reference-bro">Board Rendering Options</h2>
            <h3>Original</h3>
            This is the classic rendering mode, it's a legacy mode way back from when the game was played in the terminal!<br>
            In this mode, the number of pieces on tiles are represented by symbols, a '-' is one, '+' is two, 'W' is three, and '&block;' is four.<br>
            We keep this mode around because it has an important advantage, while it takes time to get used to, it's very easy to understand large (larger than around 11x11) boards with this mode, and we recommend it for that purpose.
            <h3>Concentric</h3>
            So named because this mode displays tiles as a grid of concentric squares, this mode makes it very easy to grasp the basic concepts of territopple, which is why it's recommended for beginners.<br>
            It's easy to tell when a tile is volatile as it will be completely filled. However, with the mode consuming all the space within the tile, it can be harder to see and notice the various highlights.
            <h3>Spherical</h3>
            This poorly named mode is not, in fact, meant to display spherical boards (coming soon-ish!). It's a 3D rendering option that displays tiles as spheres in 3D space.<br>
            This mode is currently difficult to use on mobile, as there is no way to rotate the view without a right click or keyboard inputs, this mode also does not provide any significant advantages over the others, and exists primarily as a test that the 3D rendering worked.<br>
            Due to this, we do not recommend the spherical rendering mode to anyone for serious use, but it might be cool to play around with it and see how it looks. Also, keep an eye out for the next rendering mode that will be added: '3D Towers'!
            <!-- <h2>Huge Games (Coming Soon)</h2>
            These are special games made for many people to join in on without obligation.<br>
            All players are on the same team playing against an AI opponent.<br>
            Players gain moves at fixed intervals. Whenever a player makes a move, the AI immediately makes a move as well.<br>
            There are a limited number of huge games, and some may be limited time events.<br>

        <!-- <h1 id="tactics-showcase">Tactics Showcase</h1>
        <p>This section is a showcase of some common tactics that have emerged in the course of multiple games of Territopple. While they are useful, you may prefer to discover them yourself.</p>
        <p>
            <h3>Doubling Up</h3>
            By creating a setup where there is a tile one piece away from being volatile, and multiple adjacent volatile pieces in the same volatile chain, a one-way path for toppling is made.<br>
            This allows you to safely set up topples onto your opponents without them being able to retaliate as easily.
