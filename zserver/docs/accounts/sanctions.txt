sanctions are broadly categorized under five groups.
certain sanctions do not belong to these groups as they affect only certain parts of the site (for example, puzzle submission, leaderboard, etc.)

MSB-1 of sanction_id is the bypass flag.
privilege groups can be configured to prevent certain sanctions from being applied to members of the group, this immunity is bypassed if the bypass flag is set.
MSB-2 of sanction_id is the canceled flag.
the canceled flag is applied if an appeal is accepted or the sanction is otherwise ended early

Group 0:
automatic restrictions based on account status

Group 1:
short term/non-destructive actions
chat bans, force username reset

Group 2:
medium term actions
multi-month/year bans, bans on creating rooms
NOTE: extended time bans use the same sanction IDs, just with a longer than usual expiry duration

Group 3:
indefinite/semi-destructive actions
indefinite bans, bans on playing in multiplayer contexts, flag account for deletion review

Group 4:
permanent/destructive actions
account deletion, blacklist
