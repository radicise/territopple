        WHERE:
            PAGE is Integer >= 1
            FILTER is Optional String of format: [FIELD]:[VALUE|RANGE];
                WHERE:
                    FIELD is one of ["capacity", "spectate", "full", "phase", "topo"]
                    VALUE is SWITCH FIELD:
                        "full", "spectate" -> Boolean
                        "capacity" -> Number

                        "capacity" -> MIN,MAX is Number,Number
                        default -> INVALID
        gets up to 50 room records from the list of public servers, selected by page number, optionally filtered
        if page or filter is invalid, an empty list will be returned
        filter fields are used in the following manner:
            "full" is true if the number of players is equal to the capacity AND none of the players are filler bots
            "phase" is "wait" before the host starts, "over" when someone wins, and "play" otherwise
            "capacity" is the player capacity
            "spectate" is true if spectation is allowed
            "topo" is the base part of the dimension string with the dimensions concatenated with "." as separator
                - if the value contains only the base, dimensions are not matched against
        422 indicates the data server is unwilling to process the given filter, request should be repeated with a less expensive filter
