this file describes the events that are passed between the worker manager and each worker process, and the inital sequence of messages sent when a worker is started

STARTUP:
M->W: number (worker id)

MANAGER TO WORKER:
{cmd:string} - a command to execute, the worker MUST NEVER execute commands UNLESS argv includes "--debug"
{hid:number, headers, method, url:string} - handoff with a handoff id, the worker may deny the handoff if it would overload the worker
{headers, method, url:string} - handoff without an id, the worker MUST accept the handoff
{switch:true} - worker must deny all future room creation requests
{switch:false} - chooses a room that the worker is running and acts as though that room were the target of {switch:string}, worker sends a message containing the chosen room
{switch:string} - worker MUST IMMEDIATELY send the CONN:HOLD event to all clients connected to the given room id
{export:string} - give the serialized data of the specified room
{import:Buffer} - unpack the serialized room data, send response when done
{shift:string} - send the CONN:SWCH event to all clients with appropriate data

WORKER TO MANAGER:
{hid:number, v:boolean} - v is true if the handoff was accepted
{factor_update:{connections:CONNECTION_COUNT,complexity:COMPLEXITY,turnaround:MAX_TURN}} - load factor update
{import:string} - confirms the import of the given room is complete
{export:string, data:Buffer} - room export data
{switch:string} - response to {switch:false}
