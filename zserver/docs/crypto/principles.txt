This file enumerates the fundamental principles and assumptions pertaining to all cryptography related decisions.

1. TLS is considered a minimum of security, necessary only to expose the SubtleCrypto webAPI on the client side.
2. As #1, all sensitive data should be further encrypted.
3. More than adequate security measures should be used where feasible.
4. It should intentionally be made very difficult to misuse constructs. (eg. SensitiveData prevents serialization of plaintext)
