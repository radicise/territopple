This file enumerates the fundamental principles and assumptions pertaining to all cryptography related decisions.

1. TLS is considered a minimum of security, necessary only to expose the SubtleCrypto webAPI on the client side.
2. As #1, all sensitive data should be further encrypted.
3. More than adequate security measures should be used where feasible.
4. All constructs should be designed as though RCE is possible, and requires mitigation.
5. As #4, it should intentionally be made very difficult to misuse constructs. (eg. SensitiveData prevents serialization of plaintext)
6. As #4, it should be as difficult as possible to compromise the integrity of internal cryptographic state and obtaining references directly to secrets.
