BINARY GAME TO CLIENT:
    0:
        PREREQUISITE - game must have already transmitted the size of the board to the client
        sends tile values, then ownerships. sends each from left to right, top to bottom in a continuous stream, allowing the right edge of one row to wrap to the left edge of the next
        when sending tile values:
            if the tile is a corner: one bit is sent, 0 = 1 piece, 1 = 2 pieces
            if the tile is an edge or center: two bits are sent, following the pattern as above
        when sending tile ownerships:
            if the first bit is 0: the next three bits denote team
            if the first bit is 1: the next three bits denote team, and the following four bits denote the next n tiles all being that team (run-length encoding)
