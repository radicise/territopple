GAME TO CLIENT:
    CONN: - connection notifications
        HOLD () - signals that the server will DISCARD ALL EVENTS, clients should buffer events to prevent input dropping
                - additionally, clients should make it clear to users that events are not being processed
        CONT () - signals that the HOLD state is ended, clients should send the buffered events
                - additionally, clients should make it clear to users that events are being processed
        SWCH (P [switch params]: string, D [switch data]: string[])
            - clients MUST IMMEDIATELY terminate the websocket and reconnect
            - reconnection MUST use the provided parameter string, clients MUST append it directly after the '?' in the connection url
            - when the new connection is open, clients MUST IMMEDIATELY send the switch data, sending one message per element
        DYNG () - signals that the server is in the process of moving rooms to a different server

BINARY GAME TO CLIENT:
    0:
        PREREQUISITE - game must have already transmitted the size of the board to the client
        sends tile values, then ownerships. sends each from left to right, top to bottom in a continuous stream, allowing the right edge of one row to wrap to the left edge of the next
        when sending tile values:
            if the tile is a corner: one bit is sent, 0 = 1 piece, 1 = 2 pieces
            if the tile is an edge or center: two bits are sent, following the pattern as above
        when sending tile ownerships:
            if the first bit is 0: the next three bits denote team
            if the first bit is 1: the next three bits denote team, and the following four bits denote the next n tiles all being that team (run-length encoding)
