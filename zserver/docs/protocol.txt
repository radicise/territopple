- contains a type/name of the form "[category][:specifier]+"
- optionally sends data

client-server specific:
- communicated as JSON string of the form "{"type":[type],"payload":[data]}"
- payload may be empty, but not null
- instead of JSON, may send binary data, the first byte indicates the type of data
