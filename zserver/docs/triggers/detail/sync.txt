this file documents the "sync" server->client event. the full list of events can be found in "../game-client_events.txt".

the sync event is used to synchronize data between the client and server, it should be used for data which is either not obvious to clients entering a game or for data which changes over time in an unpredictable way (eg. timers that may be paused).

the sync event allows arbitrary fields to be synced across the client-server boundary by targeting certain types of data. this targeting is done in an abstract manner, such that clients may have different in-memory representations of the data and still remain capable of synchronization.

data is encoded in the payload in the following form {[KEY]: [VALUE]}, where "KEY" is a list of specifiers separated by dots ('.'), and "VALUE" is data of the same type as the specified target.

top level specifiers target specific categories of game mechanics, the list is as follows:
"PLAYER" - data about players
"BOARD" - data about the board

the PLAYER specifier always has two subspecifiers: N and FIELD.
N is a number that targets the player with specified player number
FIELD is one of the following:
"time_left" - for turnTime rules. amount of time remaining
